    'letter': "Dear delegates, faculty advisors, and future diplomats,\n\nIt is my great pleasure to invite you to the 2nd iteration of the Haileybury Almaty Model United Nations (HALMUN), taking place from October 8th to October 9th, 2022 conducted in an online format.\n\nHALMUN challenges young diplomats to think of the most innovative and groundbreaking ideas to solve the biggest problems our world has had to face. Our conference has always believed in the power of the youth and its ability to thrive in the face of adversity. Consequently, we have decided that this year’s theme is “Preparing Today's Youth for the Challenges of Tomorrow”.\n\nOver the course of two days, you will be passing resolutions, debating world issues, and building friendships with people from all over the world. Tackling such problems will require enormous effort and unwavering perseverance, but HALMUN believes in every single one of its delegates regardless of their experience.\n\nWe look forward to welcoming you to our conference this October. In the meantime, feel free to explore our website to learn more about the conference. Do not hesitate to reach out to our team at halmunstaff@gmail.com or myself at 10kul-muhammeda@haileyburyalmaty.kz for any additional information.\n\nWe cannot wait to see you at HALMUN this October!\n\n"
