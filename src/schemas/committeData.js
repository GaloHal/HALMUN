Before exploring this topic in greater detail, key concepts should be defined and distinctions should be made to avoid any baseline misunderstandings.\n\nInflation is the rate of increase in prices of a basket of goods and services over a given period of time. The most commonly used inflation indexes are the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Wholesale Price Index (WPI). The CPI is a measure that examines the weighted average of prices of a basket of goods and services which are of primary consumer needs. The CPI is calculated by taking price changes for each item in the predetermined basket of goods and averaging them based on their relative weight in the whole basket. The prices in consideration are the retail prices of each item, as available for purchase by the individual citizens. The WPI, on the other hand, measures and tracks the changes in the price of goods in the stages before the retail level.",
