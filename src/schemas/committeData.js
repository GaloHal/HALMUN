        "chair-description": "Balancing between war and peace is no easy feat, but it is our duty as delegates to guide our world to become a better, more prosperous place. Hopefully in this conference, we can foster engrossing discussions and stimulating debates, challenge each other’s ability to think on their feet and most of all work together to reach a common goal. So, as Helen Keller once said, “Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much."

        "detailed-description": "In this committee, we will find practical and ethical solutions to important normative problems such as the technology and life interface, and governance of the use and development of frontier technologies like, big data analytics, biotech and genome editing, the Internet of things (IoT), and artificial intelligence. Our world cannot advance or achieve the Sustainable Development Goals without modern solutions to old problems. People are increasingly at risk of being left behind as innovation outpaces both the Government’s and their ability to keep up. This digital divide may widen further, so we must also help developing countries harness science and technology for their development.",

        "chair-description": "I enjoy learning about different topics within STEM and the current issues impacting the world’s scientific and technological development that people are trying to solve. I have participated in MISMUN 2019 and 2020, DRIMUN 2021, YOMUN 2021, YOMUN 2021, and HarvardMUN Dubai 2021. At most of these MUNs, I was part of committees that dealt with science and technology, and I thoroughly appreciated all of these experiences. I hope that in this committee delegates with similar passions will gather to work together on solving scientific, technological, and developmental world problems."

While numerous aspects go into achieving this objective, it cannot be fully reached unless there is worldwide medical device access. Hence, the topic for discussion at HALMUN’s WHO.",

        "chair-description": "I grew up and spent most of my life in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. It is a wonderful place to live in but unfortunately it does not always have the proper medical facilities to support its citizens. I am quite familiar with the process of having to wait for machinery to free up or for a new device to arrive at a hospital. it is tiring and stressful for everyone – the patients, their families, the doctors. The lack of medical devices and machinery is an issue that should be addressed and I am glad that you, as delegates, will get to come together and engage with your peers of diverse backgrounds to proscribe solutions to this issue."

        "chair-image": "/images/team/alinur-HALMUN.jpeg",
        "chair-description": "I am interested in bioengineering and biomedical studies. I started my MUN journey several years ago, and since then I have participated in many events and conferences, for instance: I won award for Best Delegate at YOMUN 2020, participated in MISMUN, and more. I decided to Chair the Human Rights Council because as a future bioengineer I already face ethical dilemmas and moral boundaries of what is considered “normal”. I am looking forward to having a heated debate with a peaceful conclusion. Always remember, “When the power of love overcomes the low for power, only then will the world know peace.”  – Jimi Hendrix."
